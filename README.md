# Ecoacoustic-Embeddings-using-Deep-Learning

This repository provides the training and evaluation code for a deep learning model on eco-acoustics. The regression model uses CNN Architecture to predict time of recording of soundscapes. It was developed to take audio recordings of eco-systems to learn ecological features. The Main_Training_Code was used to train the model on the dataset and the Evaluation_Code was used to generate master spreadsheets of the activation values of each neuron in the Adaptive Max Pool Layer.

This model is included in a manuscript currently under review for journal publication.
